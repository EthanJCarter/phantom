Phantom | Radiative Transfer Approximation
=========
PLEASE NOTE THAT ANY WORK REGARDING THE RADIATIVE TRANSFER APPROXIMATION FOR BOTH THE STAMATELLOS AND LOMBARDI METHODS (icooling=8) ARE NOT MY WORK.

THIS IS THE WORK OF ALISON YOUNG (fork: https://github.com/alisonkyoung1/phantom).

THIS BRANCH CONTAINS A COPY OF THE WORK ON THAT FORK SO I CAN MAKE MY OWN ADDITIONS.
